/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data ownership and protects access to user profiles and forum posts.
 * Leaderboard entries are publicly accessible for reading but require authentication for creation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores individual user profiles. Each user can only access their own profile.
 * - `/forumposts/{postId}`: Stores community forum posts. Any authenticated user can read and create posts, but only the author can update or delete them.
 * - `/forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}`: Stores comments on forum posts. Only the author of a comment can update or delete it.
 * - `/leaderboard/{scoreId}`: Stores Eco-Runner leaderboard entries. Publicly readable, but creation is limited to authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Forum posts are publicly readable, but only the author can modify them.
 * - Leaderboard data is publicly readable, but creation requires authentication.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts and comments include an `authorId` field to simplify ownership checks,
 *   avoiding the need for additional reads to verify authorship.
