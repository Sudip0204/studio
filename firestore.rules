/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * allows public read access with owner-only writes for forum posts, and allows public
 * read and write access for leaderboard entries.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Stores forum post data. Publicly readable, but only the author can modify.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on forum posts. Only the author can modify.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores leaderboard entries. Publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Forum posts are publicly readable but only the author can create, update, or delete them.
 * - Leaderboard entries are publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts require an `authorId` field to enforce owner-only writes.
