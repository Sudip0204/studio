/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles.
 * Community posts and comments follow a public-read, owner-write model.
 * Leaderboard entries are publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /communityPosts/{postId}: Forum posts, publicly readable, owner-writable.
 * - /communityPosts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on forum posts, publicly readable, owner-writable.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Leaderboard entries, publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Community posts are publicly readable, but only the author can modify or delete them.
 * - Leaderboard entries are completely public, for simplicity in this prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `authorId` field on `communityPosts` and `comments` is used for ownership checks, avoiding `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles are stored in a dedicated /users/{userId} collection to ensure privacy.
