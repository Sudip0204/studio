/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity Application
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and content ownership.
 *  - It enforces strict user-ownership for profile data and allows public read access to forum posts while controlling write access to authorized users.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *  - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 *  - Forum posts are stored in the top-level `/forumposts/{postId}` collection.
 *  - Comments on forum posts are stored in the `/forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}` subcollection.
 *  - Leaderboard entries are stored in the `/leaderboard/{scoreId}` collection.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 *  - Forum posts are publicly readable but can only be created by authenticated users.
 *  - Leaderboard scores are publicly readable, but writes are open for prototyping (TODO: Restrict writes).
