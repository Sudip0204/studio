/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity App
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and enforces
 *   ownership-based access control for user profiles. It provides public read
 *   access to community forum posts and leaderboard entries while restricting
 *   write access to authorized users.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the
 *     user themselves.
 *   - /communityPosts/{postId}: Stores community forum posts, publicly
 *     readable but writable only by the post author.
 *   - /communityPosts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on
 *     community posts, writable by any authenticated user.
 *   - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores leaderboard entries, publicly readable and
 *     writable by any authenticated user.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 *   - The rules do not enforce strict schema validation to allow for flexible
 *     data evolution during the prototyping phase.
 *   - All write operations require user authentication.
