/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles.
 * Community forum posts are publicly readable but only the author can modify them.
 * Leaderboard entries are publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, secured by user ID.
 * - /communityPosts/{postId}: Stores community forum posts, publicly readable.
 * - /communityPosts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on forum posts.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores leaderboard entries, publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Community posts are publicly accessible for reading, but only the author can modify them.
 * - Leaderboard scores are publicly readable and writable.
 * - Listing all users is not allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts denormalize authorId to simplify ownership checks.
 * - Leaderboard entries denormalize userId and username.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under the /users/{userId} collection, while public forum posts are stored in the top-level /communityPosts collection.
