/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and allows public read access to certain collections while restricting write access to authorized users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Each user can only access their own profile.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product listings. Allows public read access, but only the seller can modify/delete their own product.
 * - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Stores recycling center data. Publicly accessible.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: Stores user rewards. Only the owning user can access their rewards.
 * - /forumposts/{forumpostId}: Stores forum posts. Allows public read access, but only the author can modify/delete their own post.
 * - /users/{userId}/userstats/{userstatsId}: Stores user statistics. Only the owning user can access their statistics.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted for the `/products` and `/recyclingcenters` and `/forumposts` collections.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for all user-specific data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Write access to `/products` and `/forumposts` is restricted to the owner of the document.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Product` and `ForumPost` entities should have an `ownerId` or `authorId` field (respectively) to enable owner-only write access.
 *   This avoids costly `get()` calls to the `/users/{userId}` collection to verify ownership.
