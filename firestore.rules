/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data ownership and restricts access to specific user-related data. Public data such as forum posts is readable by anyone, but write access is controlled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /products/{productId}: Marketplace product listings, publicly readable, writable only by the seller.
 * - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Recycling center data, publicly readable and not writable by users.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: User-specific rewards, accessible only by the user.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Forum posts, publicly readable, writable only by authenticated users and only if the authorId field matches their UID.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on forum posts, writable by authenticated users if the authorId field matches their UID.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/likes/{userId}: Likes on a forum post, writable only by the user liking the post (userId matches auth.uid).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access to marketplace listings and recycling center data.
 * - Strict ownership model for user profiles and rewards.
 * - Forum posts are publicly readable but require authentication and authorId match for writes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts include an `authorId` field to simplify ownership checks.
