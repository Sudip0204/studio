/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and community posts.
 * Users can only read and write their own profile data. Community posts are publicly readable but only the author can modify or delete them.
 * Leaderboard entries are publicly readable and writable to facilitate score submissions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /communityPosts/{postId}: Stores community forum posts.
 * - /communityPosts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for a specific post.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores leaderboard entries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user profile data. Listing users is disallowed.
 * - Community posts are publicly readable but only the author can modify or delete them.
 * - Leaderboard entries are publicly readable and writable to facilitate score submissions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `ForumPost` entity includes an `authorId` field to simplify ownership checks for posts.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public forum posts and private user data are stored in separate top-level collections.
