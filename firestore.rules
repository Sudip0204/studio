/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a mixed security model. Forum posts are publicly readable,
 * user profiles are private, and leaderboard entries are publicly writable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data. Accessible only by the user.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Stores forum posts. Publicly readable, creation requires authentication,
 *   and updates/deletions are restricted to the author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on forum posts. Creation requires authentication,
 *   and updates/deletions are restricted to the author.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores leaderboard entries. Publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Forum posts are publicly readable to allow for open community discussion.
 * - User profiles are private and accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Leaderboard entries are publicly writable to allow anyone to submit scores, but could be open to abuse and
 *   should be monitored. Consider rate-limiting or requiring authentication in a production environment.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts include an `authorId` field, which is essential for restricting updates and deletes to the original author.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles are stored in a dedicated `/users/{userId}` collection to clearly separate private data from public forum content.
