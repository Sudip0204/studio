/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for EcoCity.
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and rewards,
 * allows public read access to products and recycling centers, and implements ownership for forum posts and comments.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, owned by the corresponding user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Marketplace product listings, publicly readable but owner-writable.
 * - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Recycling center data, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: User-specific rewards, owned by the corresponding user.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Forum posts, owner-writable by the author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on forum posts, owner-writable by the comment's author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/likes/{userId}: Likes on forum posts. A document exists if a user likes a post.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - User profiles are strictly private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Products and recycling centers are publicly readable to encourage discovery.
 * - Listing of the /users collection is denied to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Forum posts are publicly listable, but modification is restricted to the author.
 * - Forum post likes are controlled via document creation/deletion, where the existence of the like document indicates a like by the user.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - Forum posts require an `authorId` field to easily determine ownership for updates and deletes.
