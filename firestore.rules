/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset defines access control for the EcoCity application's Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 *  This ruleset prioritizes user data ownership and restricts access to personal data.
 *  Community forum posts are publicly readable, but posting requires authentication. Leaderboard scores are publicly available.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 *  - /communityPosts/{postId}: Contains community forum posts.
 *  - /communityPosts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Contains comments for each post.
 *  - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores leaderboard entries.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 *  - Community posts are publicly readable, but only authenticated users can create, update or delete posts.
 *  - Leaderboard scores are public and anyone can submit their score.
 *
 *  NOTE: These rules prioritize authorization and relational integrity. Data shape validation (e.g., field types) is omitted for prototyping speed.
