/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, rewards, and user statistics,
 * while allowing public read access to products, recycling centers, and forum posts.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores product listings, publicly readable but writable only with correct ownership.
 * - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Stores recycling center data, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: Stores user-specific reward data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /forumposts/{forumpostId}: Stores forum posts, publicly readable but writable only with correct ownership.
 * - /users/{userId}/userstats/{userstatsId}: Stores user statistics, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data, rewards, and statistics.
 * - Products and forum posts should have an authorId, which the rules validate on creation.
 * - Products and forum posts can be publicly read, but only the owner can modify/delete them.
 * - Listing of user-owned subcollections (rewards, userstats) is allowed to the owner.
 * - Recycling centers are publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Products and ForumPosts MUST contain a `sellerId` or `authorId` field, respectively, to enable
 *   owner-based access control. This avoids the need for costly `get()` calls to a separate `/users/{userId}`
 *   document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data (profile, rewards, stats) is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path,
 *   while public data (products, recycling centers, forum posts) is stored in top-level collections.
