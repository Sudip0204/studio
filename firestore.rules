/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and content ownership.
 * Users can only read and write their own profile data. Forum posts are publicly readable,
 * but only the author can modify or delete them.  Leaderboard scores are publicly readable,
 * but writes should eventually be restricted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Stores community forum posts. Public read access; owner-only writes.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on forum posts. Public read access; owner-only writes.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores Eco-Runner high scores. Public read access; write access open in the prototyping phase.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles and forum posts.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Forum posts MUST contain an `authorId` field that matches the authenticated user's UID for write operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Draft forum posts are not supported in this initial ruleset.
