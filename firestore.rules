/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model:
 *   - User profiles and rewards are strictly owned by the user.
 *   - Marketplace listings and forum posts are publicly readable but writable only by the owner.
 *   - Recycling center data is publicly accessible.
 *   - Likes are public and depend on the auth id to represent each user's like
 *
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 *   - /products/{productId}: Marketplace product listings.
 *   - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Recycling center information.
 *   - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: User-specific rewards.
 *   - /forumposts/{postId}: Forum posts.
 *   - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on forum posts.
 *   - /forumposts/{postId}/likes/{userId}: Likes on forum posts.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users can only read/write their own profile and rewards data.
 *   - Marketplace listings and forum posts are publicly readable, but only the owner can modify them.
 *   - Listing all users is denied.
 *   - Recycling center data is public.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - The `ForumPost` entity requires an `authorId` field to enforce ownership for updates and deletes.
