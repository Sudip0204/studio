/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and addresses.
 * Users can only read and write their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores user-specific address data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user document and associated subcollections.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy.
 * - All writes are validated against the authenticated user's ID.
