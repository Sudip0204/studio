/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * allows public read access to forum posts and leaderboard entries,
 * and restricts write access to forum posts and comments to authenticated users with valid data.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile data. Access is restricted to the owner (the user with matching userId).
 * - `/forumposts/{postId}`: Stores forum posts. Publicly readable, but write access is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - `/forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}`: Stores comments on forum posts. Write access is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - `/leaderboard/{scoreId}`: Stores leaderboard entries. Publicly readable, but write access is not explicitly defined and thus denied.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public read access is granted to forum posts and leaderboard entries.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles.
 * - Write operations on forum posts and comments require authentication.
 * - Leaderboard entry creation is not defined and thus denied, pending clarification.
