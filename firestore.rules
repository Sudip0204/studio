/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where users can only
 * access their own profiles, addresses, and rewards.  It prioritizes secure
 * access over complex data validation in this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/addresses/{addressId}: Stores user addresses.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: Stores user rewards.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list rewards that belong to them, as per the provided error.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing on ownership and existence checks for writes.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: N/A, the data model is already structured for owner-based authorization.
 * Structural Segregation: N/A
