/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EcoCity application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data protection and enforces secure access to various application features.
 * User-specific data is strictly controlled, while public data is accessible to all users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores marketplace listings. Publicly readable, but write access is restricted to the seller.
 * - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Stores recycling center data. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: Stores user rewards. Accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Stores forum posts. Publicly readable, write access for the author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on forum posts. Publicly readable, write access for the author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/likes/{userId}: Stores likes on a post. Write access granted if the user hasn't liked it yet.
 * - /leaderboard/{scoreId}: Stores Eco-Runner high scores. Publicly readable, write access restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Marketplace listings and forum posts are publicly readable, but only the seller/author can modify them.
 * - Leaderboard data is publicly readable.
 * - Listing of user documents is not permitted for security reasons.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - MarketplaceListing documents contain a `sellerId` field, enabling quick ownership checks for update/delete operations.
 * - ForumPost documents contain an `authorId` field for similar ownership checks.
