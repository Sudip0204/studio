/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a security model that requires users to be authenticated before accessing the community forum.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores marketplace product listings. Read access is public, but write access is restricted to the seller.
 * - /recyclingcenters/{recyclingcenterId}: Stores recycling center data. Read access is public, and write access is denied.
 * - /users/{userId}/rewards/{rewardId}: Stores user-specific rewards. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}: Stores forum posts. Read access is public, but write access is restricted to the author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on forum posts. Write access is restricted to the author.
 * - /forumposts/{postId}/likes/{userId}: Stores likes on forum posts. Write access is restricted to the user who likes the post.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users must be authenticated (signed in) to access the forum.
 * - Read-only collections (e.g., recycling centers) have public read access.
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the user themselves.
 * - Forum posts are publicly readable, but only the author can modify or delete them.
 * - Likes are managed through the existence of documents in the `/forumposts/{postId}/likes/{userId}` subcollection.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Product` entity includes a `sellerId` field to simplify ownership checks for product listings.
 * - The `ForumPost` entity includes an `authorId` field to simplify ownership checks for forum posts.
